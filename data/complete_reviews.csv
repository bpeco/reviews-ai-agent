Midas,"I had them replace two broken studs on my right rear wheel, these had been cross threaded by another shop that remained unknown until I purchased new tires. The did repair the two broken studs but in doing so cross threaded two more. I discovered this just yesterday while swapping summer to snow tires. (I have separate wheels for the winter and summer). While removing the lug nuts from the right rear wheel two lugs were extremely difficult to remove such that I had to use a 4' breaker bar to back the lugs off. The breaker bar was needed to completely remove the lug nuts. Two existing lugs were severely damaged due to cross threading. The shop states that is normal and occurs frequently. ""We did not damage your lugs"" was their response. The car is not old enough to suffer that kind of wear, they just will not admit to their mistake. Extremely disappointed in their service and negligence. See attached photos, beyond the seat of the lug nut the remaining section of the lugs are in good shape and did NOT wear out.",Hi Henry our Customer Service Team would be happy to assist you.

Midas,"I'm not sure why people rate this place poorly. I've been using this place for many years, service has always been great. Honest and fair prices too. Let's face it, an auto repair these days cost much more than years ago thanks to evolving technology. So if you're expectations are to repair your car for $20, then it's time to buy a bike. I've brought my 2013 ford Taurus SHO, 2007 GMC Yukon, 2004 Cadillac escalade, 2009 ford flex, 2006 Cadillac CTS, suburban, and many other cars. Never once was I treated poorly or over sold on products. And a BIG plus is you can bring your own parts in and they'll install it! (No warranty of course). I recently had my Yukon in before going to DC with our 5 children and luggage. They fixed a knock sensor and looked over the overall condition to make sure it was road worthy, and I only paid about $250. This was a great deal considering the GMC dealer probably would have cost twice as much and wouldn't get me in for a week. Great job midas Rutland. For all those skeptical, just try it!","Hi Eric, thanks for sharing! We appreciate your loyalty to our shop and are glad to hear you enjoy each service with us.

Keyser Energy,"I spoke to a lot of companies,  if not all in VT. Most were very nice up until the point when asking questions. As a customer who will be paying money that I worked hard for, I would expect clear and calculated answers. Keyser Energy was by far the most informative,  professional and understanding for my unique situation.  General or District Manager was very helpful. I was not easy to deal with given the circumstances I was in but the guy was a professional. Service department was awesome. Corporate experience was quick and gentlemen was very funny throughout process.  The guys who came to my home to install tank, check leaks and actually in detail explain the procedures as they were working was simply the BEST. This should be the only company or other companies should seek their model, professional services and support.  Thank You Keyser Energy and everyone that helped me get services up and running. Life raising a 3 yr old boy is hard enough but you company has made that a lot easier. Laundry, heating and cooking are all good. Thx again!!!","Thank you for the wonderful review Kevin.

Keyser Energy,"Keyser is terrible. I explained my exact request on the phone and they claimed they could handle it. After waiting all day for them to show up, they weren't able to perform the requested oil fill and instead tried to upsell me on a new tank. Meanwhile, the driver was bad mouthing the company and their polices the entire time he was here. I was beyond outraged with their service and the next day I called another company which filled the tank in about an hour without any of the drama. Use anybody else!","Hi Casey, we're sorry to hear about your less than satisfactory experience with Keyser Energy and hope that you will accept our sincerest apologies.

County Plumbing & Heating,"For years I have relied upon these guys to solve problems for me on an emergency basis and for years they have delivered. I run the vacation and long term rental department at a local real estate firm with over 100 properties in the Stowe area. Whenever I call these guys for an emergency they answer the phone right away, they arrive when they say they will and they get the job done courteously and expediently without over charging for their services. I don't know what I'd do without them. Over the summer it was for water pressure problems and plumbing issues.This week they came through for me again during the busy holiday season for at 7:30 in the morning for a problem with my own furnace on a sub-zero day and at 8:30 am for frozen pipes in a property up at Mt. Mansfield where we had vacation rental guests. You guys are the best! I feel lucky to have service people I can rely upon myself and recommend to my clients. Five stars aren't enough.

Then leave it open so the cashier can check then seal the bag. Lots of folks ordering take away eat outside of home.  Makes napkins and ketchup good to have.  Or leave them out for customers but I think COVID makes self serve impossible and age that it leads to waste because people often take more than they will use.\n\nAgain 4 stars because food is good and any issue is easy to fix (especially if you open it and look).

Midas,"I'm not sure why people rate this place poorly. I've been using this place for many years, service has always been great. Honest and fair prices too. Let's face it, an auto repair these days cost much more than years ago thanks to evolving technology. So if you're expectations are to repair your car for $20, then it's time to buy a bike. I've brought my 2013 ford Taurus SHO, 2007 GMC Yukon, 2004 Cadillac escalade, 2009 ford flex, 2006 Cadillac CTS, suburban, and many other cars. Never once was I treated poorly or over sold on products. And a BIG plus is you can bring your own parts in and they'll install it! (No warranty of course). I recently had my Yukon in before going to DC with our 5 children and luggage. They fixed a knock sensor and looked over the overall condition to make sure it was road worthy, and I only paid about $250. This was a great deal considering the GMC dealer probably would have cost twice as much and wouldn't get me in for a week. Great job midas Rutland. For all those skeptical, just try it!","Hi Eric, thanks for sharing! We appreciate your loyalty to our shop and are glad to hear you enjoy each service with us.

Keyser Energy,"I spoke to a lot of companies,  if not all in VT. Most were very nice up until the point when asking questions. As a customer who will be paying money that I worked hard for, I would expect clear and calculated answers. Keyser Energy was by far the most informative,  professional and understanding for my unique situation.  General or District Manager was very helpful. I was not easy to deal with given the circumstances I was in but the guy was a professional. Service department was awesome. Corporate experience was quick and gentlemen was very funny throughout process.  The guys who came to my home to install tank, check leaks and actually in detail explain the procedures as they were working was simply the BEST. This should be the only company or other companies should seek their model, professional services and support.  Thank You Keyser Energy and everyone that helped me get services up and running. Life raising a 3 yr old boy is hard enough but you company has made that a lot easier. Laundry, heating and cooking are all good. Thx again!!!","Thank you for the wonderful review Kevin.

I was beyond outraged with their service and the next day I called another company which filled the tank in about an hour without any of the drama.

County Plumbing & Heating,"For years I have relied upon these guys to solve problems for me on an emergency basis and for years they have delivered. I run the vacation and long term rental department at a local real estate firm with over 100 properties in the Stowe area. Whenever I call these guys for an emergency they answer the phone right away, they arrive when they say they will and they get the job done courteously and expediently without over charging for their services. I don't know what I'd do without them. Over the summer it was for water pressure problems and plumbing issues.This week they came through for me again during the busy holiday season for at 7:30 in the morning for a problem with my own furnace on a sub-zero day and at 8:30 am for frozen pipes in a property up at Mt. Mansfield where we had vacation rental guests. You guys are the best! I feel lucky to have service people I can rely upon myself and recommend to my clients. Five stars aren't enough.

Then leave it open so the cashier can check then seal the bag. Lots of folks ordering take away eat outside of home.  Makes napkins and ketchup good to have.  Or leave them out for customers but I think COVID makes self serve impossible and age that it leads to waste because people often take more than they will use.\n\nAgain 4 stars because food is good and any issue is easy to fix (especially if you open it and look).

Walking into Vacum City I didn‚Äôt know what to expect.  Did they have the part, if not could they get and I wasn‚Äôt going to pay a lot either.  To my surprise the mechanic guy and the woman office manager took great care of me.  Yes, they did have the part and it wasn‚Äôt going to cost a lot.   Talk about relief!

Let me reiterate: your receipt means nothing here.\n\nThey'll low-ball you on absolutely everything.  Most of the laptops they get are donations because people think they're making a difference, but in reality they just cannibalize the parts for their overpriced repairs while fooling everyone into thinking they're some kind of charity.  I'm sure they donate at least a handful of dinosaur laptops a year to get a tax break on that pricy downtown storefront.\n\nMany of the accessories are used or off-brand garbage they then try to sell for premium prices.

Build A Bagel,"Hey, guess what Saint Albans? You have a SUPER GREAT bagel cafe in town now! Yeah, I knew it was there too, I'd drive by it on Main Street telling myself ""Gee, I need to stop by there sometime"". Well, I finally did stop by and boy was I impressed!\n\nNicely spacious dining area with cool and quirky art on the walls. I like the vibe. I didn't feel corralled into a bagel eating pen, I felt like I was in a relaxing, chill spot to sit and enjoy good coffee and great bagels.\n\nThey serve various roasts of Green Mountain Coffee, hot and available. Bagels are fresh, can be toasted and delivered to your table while you wait. Huge selection of sandwiches all made from scratch.\n\nService is very friendly, welcoming and patient. I didn't feel rushed or pushed around. I felt so much more catered to here than I have in actual sit down restaurants!\n\nThey are quick and everything came out fresh. I went with sesame and garlic&herb bagels toasted with veggie cream cheese. The cream cheese is plentiful and tasty. The toasting isn't to the point of crisped but just before that, resulting in an evenly warm, tasty bagel!\n\nI can't recommend this place enough. Oh and if you're concerned about seeking parking on Main Street, there is parking in back off of Lake Street, just pull into the Courthouse and drive back. It's then a quick walk around the block from there! Do it!  You won't be disappointed.",None,5,5.0,28

Kinney Drugs,I wasn't very impressed when I went up after calling the Pharmacy @ 8:40 am. When I was talking to the girl on the phone she cldnt even pronounce my medication which was a generic version. When I called she told me than that they had my other 2 ready and she was currently working on the 3rd.\nWhen I went up 50 mins later @ 9:30 I was lied 2 by the person running the window 4 vehicles when she had only given me the 2 prescriptions that the lady already said were ready. Once I went to the same window & the same girl lied to me saying that I talked to a pharmacist earlier on the phone who told me it wld be another entire hour b4 it wld be ready which NEVER EVER EVEN HAPPENED! If that indeed was the TRUTH than why wld she than tell me to come back in another entire hour. That makes absolutely no sense & is a contradiction to her 1st lie to me. I'm not very impressed at all w/ being lied to by a girl in the Pharmacy Dept. Because if she had honestly said an hour and I called @8:40 am & my ride & I got there @ 9:30 than why than wld she even say to me that I needed to wait an additional hour on top of another hour. If the ppl working in the Pharmacy are strait up lying to your customers than there is something very strange & EXTREMELY UNETHICAL in such BEHAVIOR is TRULY uncoming of a pharmacy! I'm with out a vehicle right now & found it EXTREMELY unprofessional to straight up lie to me as a customer.

Fiddlehead at Four Corners,"I'm late on the reviews for the Bennington area and this is some that deserves a 5 star from me.\n\nThe one that runs the Facebook page got me all excited about the place the way he comments about his customers so I FINALLY got to go there on September 28th of 2014 to have fun in the chalk vault & look around before cashing out. I don't know how the heck he knew what I was looking for, despite not being there that day but when I was cashing out, the cashier had what I was going to cash out with but it was completely in my favorite color. I was overly excited about it & I made sure to keep it in a safe place so if any friends where I live that likes it, I can easily say that I got it in a place 27-30 hours (1100-1200 miles) north from here.\n\nIn short, I bought a soap that looked like a big rock & 5 years later, still in a bag surrounded by bubble wrap, and still smell the same as the day I bought it so hopefully it'll be a good way to get some Floridians up there. I cant wait to play (carefully) on the piano and buy something else from Fiddlehead.\n\nThank you from Florida. :-D\n\n(Credit goes to: Joey for making me fall in love with Fiddlehead & Nina for being a great cashier that day.)","We remember your visit so well, George!

Sommers Chiropractic,"Lovely Staff - Most professional and very sweet - though I never received an adjustment. I called to schedule an appointment and asked if they accepted my insurance (we have MVP Vermont). I was told there should be no issue. I asked still, if they could run my number to assure they would accept MVP,  out of respect of both of our invested time. They assured me again, most everyone is covered - I accepted this and schedule my appointment. After I went through the full consultation (which was comprehensive and pleasant), I was then informed I was out of Network and then, of the 89.00 cost for screening, etc. When I arrived, I had spoke with the same girl I did the day before, when I asked if I could get pre-approved. I honestly feel this approach is misleading. I believe they feel their presentation would be so enticing, a potential client would accept the out-of-network expenses.  I have asked other establishments to run my card to see if I was covered and this has never been an issue. I offered 3 stars, for they were very pleasant to speak with.",None,3,4.9,218

I also had a my first piercing done with Haley and she really put me at ease! The whole process was quick, friendly, and professional! I felt incredibly comfortable at Onyx and the piercings are super even and healing great! You couldn‚Äôt find a better shop in Burlington for your piercing or tattoo needs! From what I‚Äôve seen, every artist on the staff creates fantastic work so you can‚Äôt go wrong!",None,5,4.9,56
Onyx Ink,"Alisha and her team at Onyx are honestly the best out there! Onyx is an extremely well run, exceptionally clean, first class shop. Alisha is such a talented artist - i have had 5 or so appointments with her over the past few years and have always had a really great experience.\n\nIf your looking for a tattoo or piercing, Onyx should be your first choice - their Instagram is a great portfolio! Highly recommended",None,5,4.9,56
Onyx Ink,"It is an absolutely wonderful set up. It is bright, colorful, welcoming, and happy! Very aestheticly pleasing, and staffed by truly unique,  artistically talented people. Two of my children had piercings done that day, and both were done with great care, and expertise. Every detail was discussed from placement, to after care. We couldn't be more pleased,  and plan on returning.",None,5,4.9,56

Lift vt,"Enjoy the gym, friendly staff, good workout equipment.   Nice to see a gym add new equipment which Lift Vt does",None,5,4.7,48
Lift vt,"Lift is the gym to go to when you're ready to get serious about your routines. They offer boot camp classes, a wide variety of machines, more squat racks than you can imagine, multiple free weight areas, CrossFit necessities, tractor tires, great music always blasting, and the best thing is there is no such thing as the dreaded ""lunk alarm"" as you're free to work out in whatever way suits you. You'll be lifting with the best of the best, but all are made to feel welcome.",None,5,4.7,48
